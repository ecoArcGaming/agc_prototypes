# Intro
To get everybody onboarded, we will use this document to make sure the development workflow is good to go. Please create a section with your NAME, list 2-3 skills you want to develop as a part of this project, and your favorite game. 
# Team
1. Erik: I'd like to work on FPGA and embedded ML skills. I mostly enjoy JRPGs like Ace Attorney, Persona, etc.

2. Abbas: I'd like to work on PCB Design, deep learning, and embedded systems. My favorite games are Street Fighter, Marvel Rivals, Smash Bros. 

3. Catherine: Not sure yet, but I'd like to gain experience with embedded development and working as part of a larger team (dividing tasks/source control, etc.). I lowkey don't play games =_=;
   
4. Gladys: I want to work on FPGA (got some experience with my hardware class last semester but would like to do more), PCB design, and embedded systems. I don't really play games but sometimes play Minecraft with my younger brother back home :) 

5. Nicholas: I'd wish to learn and explore PCB Design as well as have some more fun with microcontrollers (Arduinos, though I'd also like to learn Raspberry Pi). I usually don't play games alot (Minecraft) and usually play mobile games on my phone. (Geometry Dash)
